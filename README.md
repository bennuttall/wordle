# Wordle

Some Python code to help solving Wordle by reducing the wordlist down based on previous solutions,
previous guesses, and suggesting guesses based on total letter scores based on the possible
remaining solutions.

## Wordlist

The Wordle wordlist is downloaded from the original game: [words.txt](words.txt)

## Solutions list

The solutions list is added to every day. I aim to keep it up-to-date and accurate and check it
periodlically for missing words: [solutions.txt](solutions.txt)
